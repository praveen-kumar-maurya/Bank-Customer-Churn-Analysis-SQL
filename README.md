# **Tables used**
1. Bank_Churn
2. Active_Customer
3. Credit_Card
4. Exit_Customer

# **Problem Statement**
The aim of this project is to understand the key factors influencing churn and create strategies to reduce customer attrition.

# **Project Summary**
A bank customer churn analysis was conducted using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Three new tables were added to the database: active_customer, credit_card, and exit_customer. The tables were loaded into PostgreSQL and the analysis was performed entirely in PostgreSQL. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted, and useful insights were derived. Recommendations were then made to reduce customer churn. The analysis revealed that incentives need to be offered to customers who are at risk of churning, such as discounts, additional benefits, or personalized outreach. This includes customers with Fair or Poor credit scores, inactive customers, customers with credit cards, customers in Germany or France, customers who only use one product, customers who have been with the bank for 1 year, and customers in the age group of 41-50 and with a balance of 100,000-150,000.

# **Business Objective**
The objective of bank customer churn analysis is to examine data and identify patterns, trends, and factors influencing customer churn. By analysing customer demographics, account activity, product usage, and satisfaction metrics, significant predictors of churn can be determined. Personalized retention strategies will be implemented, including tailored incentives, loyalty programs, and proactive support, to mitigate churn risk. Achieving this objective will improve customer retention, boost profitability, foster long-term customer relationships, and establish a competitive advantage in the banking industry.
